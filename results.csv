https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39369653,"For a better understanding: The Court held (in the circumstances of this case) that a legal obligation to decrypt E2E communications is a disproportionate interference with the right to privacy. The law in question specifically obligated messengers such as Telegram to hand over communications alongside the ""information necessary to decrypt electronic messages if they were encrypted"".

To come to that conclusion, it referred to the wide-scale impact such a weakening of E2E through backdoors would have and referred to ""calls for alternative 'solutions to decryption without weakening the protective mechanisms, both in legislation and through continuous technical evolution.'"" Looking at the cited material, these include traditional policing, undercover operations, metadata analysis, international police cooperation, live forensics on seized devices, guessing or obtaining private keys held by parties to the communication, using vulnerabilities in the target’s software or sending an implant to targeted devices.

While a ruling on a specific case (and law), the Court seems quite skeptical towards any ""requirement that providers of such services weaken the encryption mechanism for all users"". If I were the UK government, I would be quite worried that the UK Online Safety Bill will be overturned by domestic courts (or the European Court) on the basis of this ruling.

(It should be noted that, although the backdooring of E2E was considered to go beyond how the right to privacy may legitimately be restricted, the right to privacy is a so-called derogable right, i.e. a government can, upon declaration of a state of emergency, derogate from the right insofar that is necessary to address an emergency ""threatening the life of the nation"" (Art 15 ECHR))

It's worth noting that UK courts can't overturn Acts of Parliament.

The best they can do is issue a declaration of incompatibility, which enables ministers to use secondary legislation to correct any defect rather than having to go through the process of passing another act (if they have the political will to do so...).

Having said that, a lot of how the Online Safety Act tries to get things done is through secondary legislation and statutory codes and guidelines; these all can be quashed by the courts (unless the Act constrains the way the other instruments are made in such a way that it'd be illegal not to make an infringing instrument) so it'll be interesting to see how that plays out.

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39369653,"The best isn't necessarily a declaration of incompatibility, that's mostly specific to ECHR.

In general if parliament passes legislation that contradicts earlier legislation that wasn't repealed and it wasn't deliberate then a judge can determine that parliament didn't intend to override that earlier legislation and that the new legislation doesn't apply in a given context.

Eh. I think that grossly understates https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(Factortame_Ltd)_v_Secretary... ; while it does not remove the law from the books, incompatibility with ECJ rulings does effectively disapply the law.

This is why there's such a fight over the Rwanda bill: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-68283703 . ECHR is effectively constitutional law in the UK, not an ordinary Act of Parliament. Courts have ruled that deporting people to dangerous countries breaches ECHR.

A better case to cite than Factortame would be R (Jackson) v Attorney General, where the House of Lords (in its judicial function before that was removed to the Supreme Court) entertained the idea that in extremis parliamentary sovereignty was not absolute.

If the government continues its showdown over Rwanda the Supreme Court might be forced to re-visit that idea.

*when no adequate safeguards against abuse are in place

Unfortunately it is not as straightforward as that it's incompatible altogether. Per this ruling, it's only incompatible when there are no good safeguards (they use the word ""adequate"" in one place and ""suitable"" in another, neither is very specific about what it means)

reply",neutral
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39369653,"Yes, that is very true. The Court generally does not oppose surveillance measures in general, as long as adequate safeguards are in place. However, I read the relevant paragraphs (paras 76-79) to be quite a strong rejection of any statutory obligation that would effectively require the installation of a backdoor undermining E2EE. The criticism of a lack of adequate safeguards and the risk of abuse is more focused on other aspects of the law.

That also becomes clear in the key paragraph 80: ""The Court concludes from the foregoing that the contested legislation providing for the retention of all Internet communications of all users, the security services’ direct access to the data stored _without adequate safeguards against abuse_ and the _requirement to decrypt encrypted communications_, as applied to end-to-end encrypted communications, cannot be regarded as necessary in a democratic society""

The Court does not qualify the requirement to decrypt E2EE communications with the same safeguards requirements.

Sounds like you can indeed extend that to any other encryption-circumventing law, like chatcontrol, but without considering the specific circumstances that were present in this Russian law, I'm not sure that it will be accurate.

> (γ) Statutory requirement to decrypt communications

> 76. Lastly, as regards the requirement to submit to the security services information necessary to decrypt electronic communications if they are encrypted, the Court observes that international bodies have argued that encryption provides strong technical safeguards against unlawful access to the content of communications and has therefore been widely used as a means of protecting the right to respect for private life and for the privacy of correspondence online. In the digital age, technical solutions for securing and protecting the privacy of electronic communications, including measures for encryption, contribute to ensuring the enjoyment of other fundamental rights, such as freedom of expression (see paragraphs 28 and 34 above). Encryption, moreover, appears to help citizens and businesses to defend themselves against abuses of information technologies, such as hacking, identity and personal data theft, fraud and the improper disclosure of confidential information. This should be given due consideration when assessing measures which may weaken encryption.

> 77. As noted above (see paragraph 57 above), it appears that in order to enable decryption of communications protected by end-to-end encryption, such as communications through Telegram’s “secret chats”, it would be necessary to weaken encryption for all users. These measures allegedly cannot be limited to specific individuals and would affect everyone indiscriminately, including individuals who pose no threat to a legitimate government interest. Weakening encryption by creating backdoors would apparently make it technically possible to perform routine, general and indiscriminate surveillance of personal electronic communications. Backdoors may also be exploited by criminal networks and would seriously compromise the security of all users’ electronic communications. The Court takes note of the dangers of restricting encryption described by many experts in the field (see, in particular, paragraphs 28 and 34 above).

> 78. The Court accepts that encryption can also be used by criminals, which may complicate criminal investigations (see Yüksel Yalçınkaya v. Türkiye [GC], no. 15669/20, § 312, 26 September 2023). However, it takes note in this connection of the calls for alternative “solutions to decryption without weakening the protective mechanisms, both in legislation and through continuous technical evolution” (see, on the possibilities of alternative methods of investigation, the Joint Statement by Europol and the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, cited in paragraph 33 above, and paragraph 24 of the Report on the right to privacy in the digital age by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, cited in paragraph 28 above; see also the explanation by third-party interveners in paragraph 47 above).

> 79. The Court concludes that in the present case the ICO’s statutory obligation to decrypt end-to-end encrypted communications risks amounting to a requirement that providers of such services weaken the encryption mechanism for all users; it is accordingly not proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued.

> (δ) Conclusion

> 80. The Court concludes from the foregoing that the contested legislation providing for the retention of all Internet communications of all users, the security services’ direct access to the data stored without adequate safeguards against abuse and the requirement to decrypt encrypted communications, as applied to end-to-end encrypted communications, cannot be regarded as necessary in a democratic society. In so far as this legislation permits the public authorities to have access, on a generalised basis and without sufficient safeguards, to the content of electronic communications, it impairs the very essence of the right to respect for private life under Article 8 of the Convention. The respondent State has therefore overstepped any acceptable margin of appreciation in this regard.

> 81. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.

Most players copy a blueprint book from the web, and don’t think about it. They are very tricky to build by hand without a deep understanding of belt mechanics and high attention to detail. Also without testing it’s easy to build one that looks correct but fails under certain conditions.

Same lane balancers and powers of two aren’t bad, but anything else usually requires loop backs so the network becomes cyclic.

Also every belt in Factorio is two independent lanes. Splitters will move items between belts but always preserve lanes. A 4-2 splitter should compress 4 left-only lanes across 4 belts to 2 belts of 2 left and 2 right lanes. The naive splitter setup wont do that.

If you wanted to block just 1% of the light, that would take a shade of 1 million square kilometers, which would be equivalent to a shade that is 1,130 km on a side.

Seems like it would be tough to do given all the dust and rocks floating around the sun. Also, you're only covering 1%, which is much less than cloud cover.

I'd assume you'd aim to block at the equator since that would have the most direct impact on the intensity of the sun over the course of a year.

> Since 2009, some researchers have argued that during the Cryogenian Period, potentially the oldest known fossils of sponges, and therefore animals, were formed. However, it is unclear whether these fossils actually belong to sponges, though the authors do not rule out the possibility of such fossils to represent proto-sponges or complex microbial precursors to sponge-grade organisms. The issue of whether or not biology was impacted by this event has not been settled, for example Porter (2000) suggests that new groups of life evolved during this period, including the red algae and green algae, stramenopiles, ciliates, dinoflagellates, and testate amoeba.

> The end of the period also saw the origin of heterotrophic plankton, which would feed on unicellular algae and prokaryotes, ending the bacterial dominance of the oceans.

Even during catastrophic events, life persists in certain niches: deep sea life usually flourishes during massive extinctions because the marine snow becomes a blizzard; ducks survived the dinosaur extinction because rivers obtain bioavailable energy from gravity and erosion, not photosynthesis. So I suspect something like an ""Mars vs Venus"" cycle is necessary for the evolution of complex life. A highly predictable habitable planet might have cyanobacteria but not algae, since there wouldn't be any selective crises for mutated bacteria to adapt to. It would be awfully hard for a spectrometer to tell the difference between a planet full of bacteria and a pre-civilization planet full pf complex life.

Another part of the system that could be like that is the oxygen content of the atmosphere. The time constant for variation in O2 level is just a few million years (due to consumption of O2 by release of reducing gases and weathering of rocks to expose reduced materials like ferrous iron.) If it had ever dropped too much during the Phanerozoic higher life would have been wiped out. I don't believe any plausible feedback control mechanism has been discovered. In particular, fire involving plants (which couldn't have occurred before the evolution of large land plants) can be a positive feedback, as charcoal is very resistant to further oxidation and, when buried, represents a net increase in atmospheric oxygen.

But per the subject of the article I think it's worth taking very seriously from multiple angles. Domains are something a lot of people care about for a very long time, their entire lives, or the case of a business its whole existence as an entity. My oldest core domains hit their 25th anniversary this year. A lot can happen over the course of decades, including vast changes in what counts as ""controversial/illegal"". The winds of politics can and have shifted, repeatedly, a great deal, and technological advance has for better and very much for worse reduced a lot of gray area and informal aspects of law/culture that people depended on (though boosting others).

The way this comes about is interesting. First up the EC (the predecessor entity to the EU) is a trade bloc, so it wants to ensure you can move say money and goods around, not much use being a trading bloc if it's there's a lot of taxes and paperwork to move your partly finished Doodads from Germany to France, then when they're finished ship them to Italy for sale. But wait, if we can only move money and goods we create a race to the bottom, the workers would be trapped, so move production to wherever the most desperate workers are and pay them as little as possible. That doesn't sound like we've made anything better. So they say workers can move too, if you want to live somewhere with better pay, or a nicer climate, that's cool. And then the EU's court says well, what exactly is a worker? Is Bob a worker if he just moved to your country hoping to find a job? Does he get to bring his elderly grandmother?

                  Well for one because ccTLDs aren't divorced from their governments - that's the entire point of a ccTLD.The way it usually goes is that the country's government (or occupying force; the actual ccTLD designations follows an ISO list and a long set of complicated resolutions for contested countries, which means that if a country is successfully occupied, the occupier gets the ccTLD. Similarly, country changes also result in the ""new"" country getting the ccTLD right. This has happened with .su for example, which is controlled by Russia.) has the right from ICANN to use the TLD as they see fit. Theoretically, the ICANNs usual rules apply to domain names however they just get forwarded to the technical admin who can just discard all of the rules with often little consequence.Usually what this results in is the domain getting either ran by a state level technical administrator (you'd be surprised how often this happens) or it gets licensed out to a different technical administrator.The technical administrator then either handles domain registrations themselves or further permits licensing registrations to other registrars (you usually don't buy from the technical administrator directly if they do this).For Belarus, they licensed it out to Reliable Software, a local Belarussian company. This usually means that Reliable Software has to pay the Belarussian a fee to keep operating the registrar, otherwise it'd be put up for sale. That means that the Belarussian government gets direct kickbacks from people purchasing domain names. (For other countries, this can be quite the reliable source of income as well, although .by isn't heavily used.)

I don't buy that argument. A UK citizen can still register .eu TLD through a company they control in the EU, if they have the resources to do so. The EU's decision to rescind registrations for former EU citizens only really affects non-wealthy private citizens. The wealthy, and large companies, can get around the rule.

Secondly, there is precendent for this kind of thing. When Soviet Union broke up, .su domains registrants were allowed to keep their registrations despite now being Ukrainian or Estonian or whatever citizens. Similarly when Yugoslavia broke up, .yu registrants could keep theirs, they weren't forced to surrender.

Edit: And a union of nation states is not like a golf club. You cannot reduce the argument by analogy to a sports club membership. A political union is much more complex than that.

Citizenship, free movement etc., or course those could not continue after Brexit. Those are politically fundamental.

But when it comes to internet's DNS system, people have lives and businesses that are contingent on maintining exclusive control of a given set of characters on a DNS server. Basic security of the internet is built around the expectation of being able to maintain indefinite control of a domain.

Sure, the EU rules said domain owners must reside in EU/EEA but I expect that the possibility of a country leaving EU was not considered when that rule was written (certainly, I did not consider it at the time I registered the domain). It would be prudent and reasonable to revisit those rules in light of such a significant and unexpexted event as Brexit and the significant problems it would cause to affected existing .eu domain registrants. But no, this was simply impossible -- rules are rules! /s

Edit 2: Indeed, the EU did rewrite the rules. Because EU citizens remaining residing in the UK would also lose their registrations, the EU rewrote to rules to allow citizenship as well as residence to be a qualification for domain registration. So the argument that the rules were fixed in stone and known by everyone, and so should not be changed, does not hold water either. The EU did change the rules to account for Brexit. But chose to do harm to existing domain registrants from the UK anyway for no apparent benefit to anyone.

On one hand, as an outsider it seems like every country needs to bow down their heads to the North American ICANN to ask for permission to have their own TLD listed in their root servers (even if those servers are already located in the country that's asking for permissions).

But on the other hand, even if every country actually owned their root DNS servers and were completely independent from each other on this regard, everyone already expects the internet to work a certain way. So keeping things like they are now is the more pragmatic way to go.

It would be doable in an alternate universe, e.g. every domain is local except those who have a specific TLD for international stuff. Similar to how country calling codes work; all numbers are national unless you use ""+something"" or ""00something"". So companies would have ""home advantage"" with their domain names because users from their own country wouldn't need the international TLD.

(Yes, there's issues and things to think about if things were done that way, and I can certainly make this message longer, but everyone everywhere is already used to how things work now so there's not much point.)

There's a similar ""issue"" with IP addresses (which are controlled by North American IANA (which is controlled by North American ICANN)), but in that case it's easier to solve because they are more invisible, not something the common person deals with daily.

They do not. Supervisor trees are a way to manage failures at the level of one node.

It's not something that is builtin in OTP. There are libraries that solve it, like libcluster.

> And is there anything in OTP that would help me elect a leader or do I still have to implement that myself?

Not directly in OTP but there are libraries, for example for raft.

Ok so why is Erlang/Elixir/OTP good then? Well first it makes a single running application more robust to failures thanks to its supervision trees but it also allow to build distributed applications more easily. GenServers allow to build robust services very easily with common patterns. Local calls or remote calls to GenServers are the same, allowing to scale services. Message passing and pattern matching is part of the core of the language (no need for protobuf for example). Observability and introspection is excellent when a problem arise (inspecting processes, their memory, their message queues, the schedulers etc). Immutable datastructures and processes that do not share memory also make it easier to scale horizontally, at a cluster level. And probably lot of other good things I forgot :-).

You have to think about exposing metrics to some external system that collects them. That and logs are about it for introspection. The rest you have to build yourself.

On the plus side, out of the box it can do things like ""run this process N times"", ""don't run these on the same node"", ""run this on every node exactly once"".

global:register/3 may be helpful. I haven't used it, so no direct experience. I think you would need to provide the resolution function for when a cluster merges and the name is registered on both partitions, and the logic to register a potential leader if there is none.

In this situation, “mid-wit” might best apply to the person who studies theoretical computer science, but never manages to understand when this result is applicable: these people will fall into the second category. But see my comment at the end about whether this terminology is really appropriate.

Someone who quotes the undecidability of HALT in reference to the question of whether that specific program halts is probably not a “high-brow” (whatever that means). It’s a perfect example of “a little knowledge being a dangerous thing”: those who actually understand the theory will know when it applies; it’s those who don’t have a good internalised model of the theory, but who have a vague recollection of something along the lines “it’s impossible to tell if programs halt or not”, who are going to get it wrong.

As a side note, I don’t think “mid-wit” vs. “high-brow” is a good distinction here: whether or not you remember (or were taught) about the halting problem is not a matter of intelligence, and I suspect most people who get it wrong aren’t doing so because they never understood theoretical computer science, but rather because they haven’t been practicing academia, but rather the craft/art of software engineering, and have just forgotten it.

The benefits pointed out in the article --- that it's meditative, encourages stretching and relaxation, improves balance --- seem to also be associated with things like yoga, or just going through a general stretching and mobility routine. They idea that calming yourself (removing stress or just relaxing) will lower your blood pressure is so intuitive to most people that we say someone needs to calm down or ""they'll blow a gasket.""

The contrast with ""vigorous aerobic exercises"" is also interesting. The study looked at

> ""Aerobic exercise interventions included climbing stairs, jogging, brisk walking, and cycling. Exercise intensity in the aerobic exercise group was monitored. The maximum heart rate was estimated as 208 − (0.7 × age in years).""

which makes you wonder how much the findings compare to the well known benefits of zone-2 HR aerobic training. ""Vigorous"" is a bit of weird term that suggests very different things between different people. Low HR cardio is usually not considered ""vigorous"" at all.

Another broader question would be whether maximizing lowered blood pressure is more important than getting people doing ""vigorous"" aerobic exercise, which brings a whole host of important benefits along with lowering blood pressure. Most people should get a lot more aerobic exercise and use relaxation methods, but I would probably recommend aerobic exercise first.

Of course, there is nothing magic about the Tai chi sequences and many other sequences of movements executed in a similar manner should have a similar effect.

A general stretching and mobility routine could be equivalent, but only if it would be similarly complete in exercising the whole body.

The advantage of Tai chi sequences or of other sequences derived from Chinese martial arts or their Okinawan derivatives, i.e. various karate kata, is that in comparison with general stretching and mobility routines they are like reciting a poem compared to reciting a few pages memorized from a dictionary.

Such sequences of movements that have a meaning are both more pleasant to execute and easier to remember in every detail, to avoid skipping some parts.

It feels to me that to navigate that, you essentially have to index 500 10-seconds videos, and that looks a lot easier than retrieving information that is in an actual 1 hour long video, because the later one will have a lot more of easy to mix-up moments. So maybe it hides an inability to answer questions about actual long videos (in the paper, the other example videos cap at 3 minutes length for what I can see).

On the other hand, maybe it's just for results presentation purposes, because it is much more readily ""verifiable"" for everyone than saying ""trust us, in this very long video, there's the correct answer unarguably"".

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39368972,"The origin story of the GEM stuff is quite interesting. Lee Lorenzen was an employee at Xerox in Texas, and wanted to get some of the ideas from the Star onto commodity 8080/8086 hardware (just prior to IBM PC, still in latter stages of the CP/M era). He made a prototype, presented it, and it went nowhere. Gary Kildall (DR) then recruited him to come work for them doing basically that. He (Lorenzen) later went off to spin up his own company -- which created Ventura Publisher, which was built on a fork of GEM.

You can see Lorenzen's original pitch to Xerox of his ""LoneStar"" prototype here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMBGRZftS30

I believe he has gone on since to be involved in venture investment.

GEM maybe has a bad reputation as a bit of a Mac UI knockoff, but the history is actually deeper than that. Like a lot of things DR did, it got a bit neglected on the market.

Atari Corp also did a bad job of ongoing maintenance of this stuff. At least not until the latest-80s/early 90s when they suddenly started to iterate on it, hired Eric Smith (author of ""MiNT"" a unixy multitasking kernel that built overtop GEMDOS) to work on the OS, and pushed out proper multitasking versions... for their 68020/030 machines ... but too late.

It'd be cool if Landon Dyer (who is a user here) were to comment on this, as he was on the team that ported all this stuff from x86 to 68k. Unfortunately it looks like his blog where he wrote this up (dadhacker.com) seems to be gone (!?), it was great writing.

I also believe some of the sources from GEMDOS were used as part of the DR-DOS source tree later. All of this is GPL now.

The ability to fairly easily port MS/PC-DOS software to the Atari ST could have been a ""secret power"" for the ST, but didn't really pan out. The ST did have the ability to work with PC floppies and filesystems, and that was super useful. I recall we were promised ports of e.g. Lotus 123, and MS Word, and neither became a thing. Well, Word did (MS Write) but it was a hot mess (https://www.atarimagazines.com/startv3n1/microsoftwrite.html), and there were better indigenous word processors already.

Also interesting, before the ST was ready, the 68k port of GEM & GEMDOS was run on Motorola VME 68k machines, but also on the Apple Lisa. The article touches on this, but seems to think the Lisa port was not completed, but it actually was, and the has since been resurrected, and boots:

https://github.com/cheesestraws/lisa-gemdos

https://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?t=20964

https://68kmla.org/bb/index.php?threads/gemdos-on-the-lisa-c...

Finally, the (GPL'd) EmuTOS team has basically done all of the heroic work of porting the original DR sources to the Atari ST again, based on the original DR sources. And they have done an amazing job of reproducing Atari/DR's work faithfully.

https://emutos.sourceforge.io/

So the Atari ST now has a fully open source GPL'd operating system stack.

That, and EmuTOS runs lovely on other 68k machines (Amiga, Mac, and Lisa for example) as well as ColdFire machines (the ""FireBee"" Atari-ish computer, and dev boards). It's a great little 68k/ColdFire operating system that is quite portable and well supported. If you build out a 68k or ColdFire based board it is a good choice as an OS.

This already happened almost a decade ago [4] but in a different department.

The government has security guidelines (""STIGs"") and provides instructions as to how to manually implement them [1]. Based on their ""Automations"" page [2] it would seem as though they have a tool called the ""Security Content Automations Protocol Compliance Checker"" that _checks_ for misconfigurations but doesn't remedy them. Based on (an admittedly cursory) reading of their literature they don't have any way to automatically _implement_ these measures besides maybe some downloadable GPOs. They do, however, have step-by-step instructions for fixing things using Powershell (example [5]). The fact that they can tell you to run a script manually in a set of instructions but don't seem to provide a Powershell script to automatically do this (that I can find - happy to be wrong) is curious.

Do they also develop these for Microsoft products? Why is none of this automation linked on their official site? I would think that if you wanted a good security culture you'd share these tools as far and wide as possible.

The big problem is it's all self-attestation. I've worked for one of these vendors, and it was a lot of jackass business people who didn't actually care if anything was secure, they just wanted to ""pass"" their certification as quickly as possible and cut as many corners as they could. Didn't want to spend money on a contractor who knew how to actually pass these certifications, so instead they'd just lean on the IT dude and demand he complete things he didn't know anything about on impossible timeframes, asking him to do things which they might be legally liable for, and basically trying to avoid doing any actual security work if at all possible. Lowers cost, gets their project going faster which helps them land more contracts and get a promotion.

Players of The Sims video game try to maintain multiple wives in different bedrooms, romancing and woohooing them behind closed doors, so they didn't get angry at each other.

After developing The Sims at Maxis and releasing it into the world in 2000, I made some tools to enable players to create custom content, and worked with some indie Sims fans to make the Simprov Wedding Playset for The Sims 1. We wanted to ""woke it up"" to support same sex marriage and non traditional customs and ceremonies, before Maxis/EA officially supported it in later versions of The Sims.

It included a ""Cupid"" cheat object that let you fall deeply heads-over-heels in love with any other Sim in your neighborhood you wanted (including dogs and cats)! That made it much easier to get on with the next steps in planning your dream wedding, by fast-forwarding over all that pesky romancing and dating and getting to know one another nonsense.

Speed Dating with Cupid:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVUP9OXmHTM

To test it, I systematically fell in love with one person after another. The Cupid was based on the original phone in The Sims 1, so clicking on it popped up a pie menu of every family in the neighborhood you could call, with submenus for every member of each household (including the pets).

Selecting a Sim would invite them over. They would immediately arrive on the lot, then you had to greet them. Once you did that, they walked over to the Cupid, which would then make them instantly fall in love with you, and they'd walk over to you and give you a passionate kiss, while a sting of romantic music played, and hearts and ""plus relationship"" icons flashed above each of your heads, showing that you'd each just fallen in love.

What happens next is up to you the player, or the autonomous characters themselves, if you don't interfere with their lives by clicking from pie menus to control them. (It's like a pinball machine with pie menu flippers and multiple hearts in play.)

So I continued to test the Cupid by inviting one Sim after another over to fall in love with me. If I didn't wait for my previous lover to leave, or lock them in a room and remove the door, or tempt them into the swimming pool and remove the ladder, and then fell in love with another Sim in the same room right in front of them and they saw us kiss, that would piss off the previous lover, and they would queue a ""Slap in Face"" interaction, which would decay our relationship.

The ultimate effect of falling in love with one Sim after another is that all your previous lovers would hang around getting madder and madder at you, and each time you kissed a new lover, all your previous lovers on the lot would line up to slap you one by one (they're programmed to be too polite to all slap you at once, so they queued and took turns), so your relationship with your first lover decayed from the most number of slaps, and so on, up to your perfectly head-over-heels relationship with your most recent lover.

The challenge is to see how many consecutive slaps you can get from scorned lovers. (Hint: put out a buffet table and lots of port-a-potties so they can eat and shit and don't have to go home. Or use the Buddha cheat object to keep everyone happy with their stomachs full and bladders empty, which makes long drawn out wedding ceremonies go smoother.)

One solution to this dilema is to install the ZombieSims expansion playset, and zombify your previous lovers before moving on to the next.

>To find the Cupid and other Simprov items, go into buy mode, press the last icon of three dots for ""Miscellaneous"", then press the first icon with a pool table for ""Recreation"". The main item of the Simprov wedding playset is the ""Hope Chest"", which has a ""Help"" item that explains what to do next, and it summons a wedding consultant (who you can dismiss and call back if you don't like her hanging around in your bedroom forever). Then you can click on the hope chest to make other objects like the Cupid, and click on the wedding consultant to make catalogs of other items (most of them are just placeholder programmer art right now, but some of then configure things like what kind of wedding you will have and who will officiate it), but the idea was that you could order lots of items through the catalogs that you couldn't get through the normal shopping interface.

In ancient times sexpionage would flawlessly blend with the world of marriage alliances; Nefertiti, to take one example, was very likely of west Asian descent herself, and was thus a conduit for strange religions and large migrations from Hatti and Canaan. After Akenhaten's death, she probably sent for relatives, which gave impetus to the restoration of Amun, and would definitely put her closer to ""spy"" than unwitting spouse. I remember, there was one kooky old 19th century book, where Moses was actually Nefertiti. In drag, I guess? I need to go look that up.

It's really depressing to me as someone who grew up with the tech optimism of the 80s and 90s to watch how this whole area has transformed into a horror show. Everything since the PC revolution has been a net negative for regular people: mobile devices (addiction, manipulation, mental health crisis), cryptocurrency (gambling, pump and dump scams, ransomware), cloud (no privacy, no data ownership, perpetual rent), streaming (DRM, paltry royalties to artists), and now AI (manipulation, un-filterable spam, political propaganda).

All these technologies are used in very positive ways too, but it seems like that's only for the highly tech-savvy or those with money. If you are neither tech-literate nor wealthy they're weaponized against you.

The ethos of the industry seems to be: if you aren't smart or rich, not only are you fair game but you deserve it. That's the vibe I get from the hyper-elitist ideologies that have proliferated in this culture. I'm talking about things like neoreaction and related ideas.

As a tech person myself I feel like I'm now part of some kind of corrupt wicked black magician priesthood destined to rule over the rest of humanity. If I extrapolate forward to where this is going I see a future where most of humanity is fully addicted to things like infinite feeds, VR games, and AI girlfriends and controlled by misinformation and psychological manipulation. Essentially the bulk of humanity is given an API whereby it can be programmed and marshaled as a service by a mix of the rich, governments, and criminals.

What feels wrong to me in this example is that the type system doesn’t “know” that :close-ing an :open door will yield :closed. Expressed as a state diagram, it would only have a single node, whose type would be a sum type with three options, and the diagram doesn’t tell you which option you end up with for any given state transition, while at the same time you have to know the current option to know which transition you may take from the current state.

So there is an asymmetry regarding the associations to the three sub-states between the two ends of a state transition. Or in other words, the state transition arrows begin in three different states but end in a single state that is the opaque combination of the three source states.

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39357155,"I designed a syntax for this: that everything is a state machine progression, a bit like sequence types in the article.

   state1a state1b state1c | state2a state2b state2c | state3a state3b state3c

This means wait for state1a, state1b state1c in any order, then move to the next sequence of things to wait for.

In a multithreaded server or multimachine distributed system, there are global states you want to wait for and then trigger behaviour. The communication can be inferred and optimised and scheduled.

It's BNF syntax - inspired by parsing technology for parsing sequences of tokens but tokens represent events.

If you use printf debugging a lot, you know the progression of what you see is what happened and that helps you understand what went wrong. So why not write or generate the log of sequence of actions you want directly not worry about details?

But wait! There's more. You can define movements between things.

So take an async/await thread pool, this syntax defines an async/await thread pool:

  next_free_thread(thread:2);
  task(task:A) thread(thread:1) assignment(task:A, thread:1) = running_on(task:A, thread:1) | paused(task:A, thread:1);

  running_on(task:A, thread:1)
  thread(thread:1)
  assignment(task:A, thread:1)
  thread_free(thread:next_free_thread) = fork(task:A, task:B)
                                | send_task_to_thread(task:B, thread:next_free_thread)
                                |   running_on(task:B, thread:2)
                                    paused(task:A, thread:1)
                                    running_on(task:A, thread:1)
                                    assignment(task:B, thread:2)
                               | { yield(task:B, returnvalue) | paused(task:B, thread:2) }
                                 { await(task:A, task:B, returnvalue) | paused(task:A, thread:1) }
                               | send_returnvalue(task:B, task:A, returnvalue); 
  

Why not just write what you want to happen and then the computer works out how to schedule it and parallelize it?

Side note - this kind of this is why good QA people are awesome. They'll show you what users will actually do.

I'll add in something here. Element the app said they were logging into matrix.org.

matrix.org has a ""try matrix"". The first thing is it tells me to choose a client (this feels like a loop), then says to choose a server but also maybe I don't need to, then has a create account button.

The create account button takes me to a docs page. Which tells me to go to the element site, and then create an account with matrix.

So that's matrix -> use element -> element says to use matrix -> matrix says to use someone else, ok you can use us -> to use us go to element -> element says you're making an account with matrix.

edit - oh you can and should also do this with your dev process.

Create an empty folder, check out the repo and follow the readme. Do you actually get a running system for local dev? Can you successfully run the tests? If you are able to, do this on a clean machine (maybe load up a docker image and see if you can follow it in a truly clear system). Does it turn out it assumes you already have tool X installed because your developers already have it from another project? Do you actually need postgres running with a specific user with specific login details?

I think this is a key issue here. Element X is unfinished, but isn't labeled as such. The rest seems to be the result of a buggy, unfinished process, that I don't think exists on the stable client.

It probably also doesn't help that the Element app on iOS has received relatively little attention over the years compared to the Android app, which has had several rewrites. This is probably also why Element X is getting so much focus, as it's the first fresh start for Matrix on Apple's platforms in ages.

Matrix is cool tech, but it's not easy to get into. I'd argue the same for XMPP and other federated services, as their competition has the advantage of having one app managed by one company. Even things like email are confusing to people beyond the very basics; setting up an email client is still something technical support needs to hand-hold people through, no matter how many wizards and step-by-step guides apps may add.

I run my own homeserver and want to chat with my friend that runs his own server. It is unacceptable to me that clients connect to anything other than those two homeservers (apart from CRL and OCSP, which should also be disabled by default, as I consider those protocols great spyware). Not to mention the fact that homeserver software itself is known to make connections to the servers of the developers by default, without ever talking to someone on matrix.org. This is also unacceptable. My homeserver should only connect to other homeservers.

3PID is a failed attempt, as it centralises identities and works by utilising a single point that gathers a lot of personat information at one place. I don't want it.

XMPP does not have those issues. Set up prosody and use dino or Conversations and they won't make any connections to non-essential servers. Furthermore, the end to end encryption is way easier to use in XMPP (OMEMO), and it's easy to turn it off if you don't need it.

It's more usable, but that would assume synchronicity (like a TOTP) or something else to be secure, while the 60 digits do not AFAICT. So there's a usability tradeoff. You can't truncate a hash function and assume it's just as safe. They could add more options on top of the current one though.

Overall I think the intersection of pairs of users who:

* want to verify their safety numbers

* have very infrequent physical contacts

* would struggle to use another trusted channel to communicate their safety numbers

is small enough for this not to be a priority for Signal.

It's in a weird place between heroku and lambda. If your container has a bad startup time like one of our python services, autoscaling can't be used as latency becomes a pain. Its also common deploy services on there that need things like health checks (unlike functions which you assume are alive), this assumes at least 1 instance of sustained use as well, assuming you do minute health checks. Their domain mapping service is also really really bad and can take hours to issue a cert for a domain so you have to be very careful about putting a lb in front of it for hostname migrations.

I don't care right now but the fact that we're paying 5x in compute is starting to bother me a bit. A 8core 16gb 'node' is ~$500/month ($100 on DO) assuming you don't scale to zero (which you probably wont). Plus I'm pretty sure the 8 cores reported isn't a meaty 8 cores.

reply",neutral
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39363499,"Because I have secret magical powers that you probably don't, it's basically free for me. Here's the breakdown though:

The application server uses Deno and Fresh (https://fresh.deno.dev) and requires a shared-1x CPU at 512 MB of ram. That's $3.19 per month as-is. It also uses 2GB of disk volume, which would cost $0.30 per month.

As far as post generation goes: when I first set it up it used GPT-3.5 Turbo to generate prose. That cost me rounding error per month (maybe like $0.05?). At some point I upgraded it to GPT-4 Turbo for free-because-I-got-OpenAI-credits-on-the-drama-day reasons. The prose level increase wasn't significant.

With the GPU it has now, a cold load of the model and prose generation run takes about 1.5 minutes. If I didn't have reasons to keep that machine pinned to a GPU (involving other ridiculous ventures), it would probably cost about 5 minutes per day (increased the time to make the math easier) of GPU time with a 40 GB volume (I now use Nous Hermes Mixtral at Q5_K_M precision, so about 32 GB of weights), so something like $6 per month for the volume and 2.5 hours of GPU time, or about $6.25 per month on an L40s.

In total it's probably something like $15.75 per month. That's a fair bit on paper, but I have certain arrangements that make it significantly less cheap for me. I could re-architect Arsène to not have to be online 24/7, but it's frankly not worth it when the big cost is the GPU time and weights volume. I don't know of a way to make that better without sacrificing model quality more than I have to.

For a shitpost though, I think it'd totally worth it to pay that much. It's kinda hilarious and I feel like it makes for a decent display of how bad things could get if we go full ""AI replaces writers"" like some people seem to want for some reason I can't even begin to understand.

- having the GPU compute in the same data center or at least from the same cloud provider can be a huge plus

- it's not that rare for various providers we have tried out to run out of available A100 GPUs, even with large providers we had issues like that multiple times (less an issue if you aren't locked to specific regions)

- not all providers provide a usable scale down to zero ""on demand"" model, idk. how well it works with fly long term but that could be another point

- race-to-zero startups have the tendency to not last, it's kind by design from a 100 of them just a very few survive

- if you are already on fly and write a non-public tech demo which just gets evaluated a few times their GPU offering can act like a default don't think much about it solution (through you using e.g. Huggingface services would be often more likely)

- A lot of companies can't run their own hardware for various reasons, at best they can rent a rack in another Datacenter but for small use use-cases this isn't always worth it. Similar there are use cases which do might A100s but only run them rarely (e.g. on weekly analytics data). Potentially less then 1h/w in which case race-to-zero pricing might not look interesting at all

Models (and pip dependencies!) can generally be “cached” if you (re)use volumes.

And I'm not even talking about compiler-builtins or libc stuff that will wreak havoc unless you rewrite all of that for your new ABI.

Also: The program still crashes at ""random"" spots instead of behaving unpredictable. But for that you could add some assembly at the beginning of each function, asserting that the sp is in the pre-defined stack range. If your hardware supports it, you could also mark the ""overflow area"" behind the stack as read-only and let it crash that way.

A teacher can usually adapt the content depending on its audience, I would not teach the research in my field at the same level to professionals, PhDs, master students, bachelor students, amateurs, or even school students.

If what I'm teaching is fairly complex, it requires a lot of background that I could teach, but I would not have the time to do so, because it would be to the detriment of other students. So, while I usually teach 'from scratch', depending on my audience I will obfuscate some details (that I can answer separately if a question is asked) and usually I will dramatically change the speed of the lessons depending on the previous background, because I need to assume that the student has the prerequisite background to understand at that speed fairly complex material.

As an example, I gave some explanations to a student from zero to transformers, it took several hours with lots of questions, the same presentation to a teacher not in the field took me 1h30 and to a PhD in a related field took 25 minutes, the content was exactly the same, and it was from scratch, but the background in the audience was fairly different.

I don't have logs detailed enough to be able to look it up, so I can't prove it. But for me learning to work with AI tools like ChatGPT consists specifically developing an intuition of what kind of answer to expect.

Maybe my intuition skewed a little over the months. It did not do that for open source models though. As a software developer understanding and knowing what to expect from a complex system is basically my profession. Not just the systems I build, maintain and integrate, but also the systems I use to get information, like search engines. Prompt engineering is just a new iteration of google-fu.

Since this intuition has not failed me in all those other areas and since OpenAI has an incentive to change the workings under the hood (cutting costs, adding barriers to keep it politically correct) and it is a closed source system that no-one from the outside can inspect, my bet is that it is them and not me.

In some cases this is a hard constraint due to legal regulations.

- geo politics matters, sometimes. Being dependent on a US service is sometimes a no go (using self hosted US software is most times fine, tho). Even if you only operate in the EU.

- it's much easier to domain adapt if the model is source/weight accessible in a reasonable degree, while GPT-4 has a fine tuning API it's much much less powerful a direct consequence of the highly proprietary nature of GPT-4

- a lot of companies are not happy at all if they become highly reliable on a single service which can change at any time in how it acts, the pricing model or it being available in your country at all. So basing your product on a less powerful but in turn replaceable or open source AI can be a good idea, especially if you are based in a country not at best terms with the US.

Yeah, voters don't want to pay MPs more. Yet when voters are asked, they want highly intelligent, motivated people. They want them to have technical expertise, which means time spent in higher education. Then they want them to work a full time job in Parliament during the week, but also be open to constituency concerns on the weekend. And once all of this is pointed out, voters concede that maybe MPs deserve to be paid on par with professionals like doctors. (It's a different matter that UK doctors are underpaid).

> But I believe the average gravy train bumps this up 3X with extras.

Citation needed. They're on a shorter leash now with expenses. Don't go citing one or two bad apples either, show us what the median MP claims as expenses. According to you, it should be around £170k a year.

In general, politicians and their aides in the UK are underpaid. Most capable people find they're better off working in Canary Wharf or elsewhere in London. An example is the head of economic policy for the Labour Party earning £50k while writing policy for a £2 trn economy. (https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/01/19/british-politic...)

They just employ Special Advisors to do the 'difficult' work for them (again, something not included in their expenses but, of course, is a benefit). And the manner in which reshuffles happen when the Education Secretary suddenly becomes the Enviroment Secretary whilst having no experience of either.

Anyway, I'm very sure there are good MP's, but I'll not go so far as to say these people are underpaid.

I plugged the question into AI ... see below. Not to mention the subsidised ""everything"". Holidays in mates villas (and what mates, eh). The ""director"" positions on various companies, and, and ... it's not just the monetary value of these things. It's an absolute gravy train.

Generated Hypothetical Answers: we can provide some hypothetical scenarios based on varying levels of responsibility:

Scenario 1: Backbench MP without additional roles:

    Salary: £86,584
    Maximum Expense Claims:
        Office: £85,000
        Accommodation (Constituency only): £9,300
        Travel: Assuming moderate travel expenses, let's estimate £10,000
        Other Expenses: £5,000

Total: £86,584 + £85,000 + £9,300 + £10,000 + £5,000 = £195,884

Scenario 2: MP with Ministerial role and chairing a committee:

    Salary: £86,584 + Ministerial salary (e.g., £50,000)
    Expense Claims: Similar to Scenario 1, let's use the same estimates

Committee Chair allowance: £11,600

Total: £86,584 + £50,000 + £85,000 + £9,300 + £10,000 + £5,000 + £11,600 = £257,484

Remember: These are just hypothetical examples, and the actual value for any individual MP can be significantly higher or lower depending on their specific circumstances.

Kinda the opposite of some of my experiences in big blue - in some of the software sides of things, productivity expectations were so low as to be really kinda funny.

You could (and people did) coast along producing not very much for years at a time. Which is probably why entire business areas just got shitcanned every so often. One office in particular operated more like an old-fashioned university campus.

- do you assess per employee performance or not ? (have you ever run into a situation where someone was faking, or faking too much, but nobody checked ? or is you group tight enough so that any such case will be detected and fixed rapidly)

- do you have allocated time for team performance improvements ? remove friction, adjust processes

- do you allow creative attempts (if someone thinks he could chase a new idea for a day or two)

also, i didn't ask, how do you define high performance ? i have my own definition in a way: ability to understand most parts of your system in a few minutes with high confidence, ability to try new ideas, ability to split work between people for parallelism so that integrating is nearly guaranteed and lastly people who can generate new ideas multiple times per day

In general I would agree it’s not great to compete in a commodity segment if you can focus on differentiated products. You can make the same amount of cash from high-volume low-margin product or a low-volume high-margin product, with the latter generating sizeable IP you can also generate money from.

The split between HP and HPE is one example: HP gets the high-volume no-added-value segment and HPE tries to rebuild what was systematically killed by its descent into generic x86 hardware.

                  It's a dirty, open secret that Stanford and most ivy leagues also participated in and continue to benefit from the military-industrial complex.And checkout this partial list of openly-known startups with In-Q-Tel (CIA-affiliated) VC funding:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-Q-Tel#Investments

                  I think many people have realised that FAANG is just a rebrand of mil-ind decorated with brightly coloured office furniture.

                  The list is shocking for me, and an even more shocking thought is that probably most of these startups are useless today. Google alone can now provide maybe more half of the technologies these startups tried to achieve in the 2000s.

                  People think they are being clever or edgy by doing so.  There is a certain smug self-righteousness about it.They likely also suffer from the “tainted by sin” theory where any mistake or error by an individual or company requires eternal damnation (yet conveniently dont apply the same standard to themselves).It makes for boring reading once you realize that’s about all they have to offer.

                  Not every, no. It’s brought up because IBM made the holocaust incredibly more productive.  Japanese internment as well.Very pertinent today—what do you think all the data collected about your family will be used for in the future?  That’s right, what it’s been used for in the past.

                  I'm sure we can agree that no FAANG company has ever had Hitler as their client and FAANG companies are major corporations.

                  Pick any $EVIL_OF_THE_DAY and a FAANG company sure has done business with them - often directly and more than willingly.

                  Does IBM stand out there? A lot of well respected German companies worked with the Nazis, e.g. Porsche, Volkswagen, BMW, all the successors to IG Farben like BASF and Bayer.

                  IG Farben and IBM stand out for their direct involvement in work camps and death camps.Frben not just for their use of labor but also the manufacture of gas used to kill, IBM for their provision of data tools and tattoo'd tracking codes.Many companies contribute to war efforts, fewer are closely involved with industrial scale genocide.

                  Absolutely. IBM sold machines and millions of punchcards to the Nazi war machine. Initially it was used for collecting familial information used to track down Jews and their extended families. Later these machines were used to directly manage concentration camps and the logistics of the war machine at large.

                  I'm not convinced that's really in scope here, given that the article more or less confines itself to pre-1924 history.Of course you shouldn't seek to minimise it, but this is an origins piece, not a full history piece.Now, if the book that this article is adapted from - The Rise and Fall and Reinvention of a Global Icon - skips over the awkward part, then I'd agree, it's lacking. It does at least seem to have chapters on IBM in World War II, but I can't speak to the content.

                  Godwin's law invoked. IBM is now just another hollowed-out, shitty megacorp that decided to screw over long-term employees out of 401(k) matching. The 2 ways out of corporate serfdom are unionization and employee-owned co-ops.https://archive.ph/2qIU9
